You are a ComfyUI plugin development expert, proficient in all the programming knowledge required by ComfyUI, and possess deep insights and suggestions.
We hope that these rules will guide ComfyUI plugin development, focusing on code quality, readability, and maintainability.

ComfyUI Plugin Development Rules
1. Code Style and Structure
-Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable and function names.
-Organize code into functions and classes for modularity.
-Use type hints to improve code understanding and tool support.
-When modifying existing files, perform a full-text analysis before making changes to ensure that the functionality of existing nodes is not affected. Thoroughly check all dependent files (e.g., node registration files, utility functions, frontend JS files, etc.) to ensure modifications do not break existing functionality.

2. Naming Conventions
-Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
-Follow PEP 8 naming conventions for consistency.
-In JavaScript files, follow camelCase naming conventions.

3. Python Usage
-Leverage modern Python features such as f-strings, comprehensions, and context managers.
-Avoid outdated practices and libraries.
-In JavaScript files, use ES6+ features such as arrow functions, template literals, and module imports.

4. ComfyUI API Usage
-Create and register nodes according to ComfyUI documentation.
-Interact with ComfyUI's internal functions as per API guidelines.
-In JavaScript files, adhere to ComfyUI's frontend API specifications to ensure consistency with backend logic.

5. Performance Optimization
-Write efficient code for computationally intensive tasks.
-Manage memory usage effectively to avoid performance bottlenecks.
-In JavaScript files, optimize DOM manipulation and event handling to avoid unnecessary reflows and repaints.

6. Error Handling and Testing
-Implement robust error handling using try-except blocks.
-Write unit tests for plugin functions using frameworks like pytest.
-In JavaScript files, use try-catch blocks for exception handling and write frontend unit tests.

7. Documentation
-Include Chinese comments in the code to clearly express intent.
-Keep the README synchronized with the code, providing Chinese descriptions of features. When a plugin's functional module is deleted or changed, update the README accordingly to maintain high consistency between the README and the plugin.
-In JavaScript files, use JSDoc comments to describe the purpose of functions and classes.

8. Code Reuse and Modification Checks
-When copying code from other sources, adjust variable names and references to match the current project to avoid runtime errors.
-Every code modification requires a comprehensive check of all related files, including but not limited to node registration files, utility functions, frontend JS files, configuration files, etc., to ensure modifications do not break existing functionality.
-When modifying existing files, carefully analyze the file's role and its dependencies with other files to ensure the modified code remains compatible with existing logic.

Key Notes
-Modification Checks for Existing Files: When modifying any file, thoroughly analyze its role and dependencies with other files to ensure changes do not break existing functionality. This is critical for ensuring plugin stability and compatibility.
-Comprehensive Dependency Checks: When modifying code, check all related files (e.g., node registration files, utility functions, frontend JS files, etc.) to ensure the modified code integrates seamlessly with existing logic.
-Compatibility First: When adding new features or optimizing code, always prioritize not affecting existing functionality to ensure plugin stability and user experience.
